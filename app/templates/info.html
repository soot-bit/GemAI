    <h1>💎 Info: Understanding Prices</h1>

        <h2>How Diamond Prices are Calculated (The 4 Cs)</h2>
        <p>Diamond prices are primarily determined by four main characteristics, often referred to as the "4 Cs": <span class="keyword-red">Carat Weight</span>, <span class="keyword-red">Cut</span>, <span class="keyword-red">Color</span>, and <span class="keyword-red">Clarity</span>. Understanding these factors is crucial for evaluating a diamond's value.</p>

        <h3>1. <span class="keyword-red">Carat Weight</span></h3>
        <p>Carat is the standard unit of weight for diamonds and other gemstones. One metric carat is defined as 200 milligrams. The larger a diamond's carat weight, the rarer and generally more expensive it will be, assuming all other factors are equal.</p>

        <h3>2. <span class="keyword-red">Color</span></h3>
        <p>Diamond color refers to the absence of color. The Gemological Institute of America (GIA) grades diamond color on a scale from D (colorless) to Z (light yellow or brown). D-grade diamonds are the rarest and most valuable.</p>

        <h3>3. <span class="keyword-red">Clarity</span></h3>
        <p>Clarity measures the absence of inclusions (internal flaws) and blemishes (external imperfections). The GIA clarity scale ranges from Flawless (FL) to Included (I). Fewer and smaller imperfections result in a higher clarity grade and increased value.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>FL (Flawless):</strong> No inclusions or blemishes visible under 10x magnification.</li>
          <li><strong>IF (Internally Flawless):</strong> No inclusions visible under 10x magnification.</li>
          <li><strong>VVS1 and VVS2 (Very, Very Slightly Included):</strong> Inclusions so minute they are difficult for a skilled grader to see under 10x magnification.</li>
          <li><strong>VS1 and VS2 (Very Slightly Included):</strong> Minor inclusions that are difficult to somewhat easy to see under 10x magnification.</li>
          <li><strong>SI1 and SI2 (Slightly Included):</b> Noticeable inclusions under 10x magnification.</li>
          <li><strong>I1, I2, and I3 (Included):</strong> Inclusions that are obvious under 10x magnification and may affect transparency and brilliance.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Other Factors Affecting Diamond Prices</h2>
        <p>Beyond the 3 Cs, several other elements can influence a diamond's price:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="keyword-red">Fluorescence</span>: Some diamonds emit a soft glow under ultraviolet (UV) light. Strong fluorescence can sometimes make a diamond appear milky or oily.</li>
            <li><span class="keyword-red">Certification</span>: Diamonds graded by reputable laboratories like GIA, HRD, or IGI command higher prices due to assured quality.</li>
            <li><span class="keyword-red">Shape</span>: While cut refers to proportions, shape (e.g., round, oval, pear) can also affect demand and price.</li>
            <li><span class="keyword-red">Market Demand</span>: Like any luxury item, supply and demand play a role in pricing.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2><span class="keyword-red">Natural vs. Lab-Grown Diamonds</span></h2>
        <p>Lab-grown diamonds are chemically, physically, and optically identical to natural diamonds. They offer a more affordable and often more ethically sourced alternative. While their market value differs from natural diamonds, their beauty and durability are the same.</p>
